As an introductory book on General Relativity, Professor Zhao Zheng’s book is concise and comprehensive, covering almost all the essential topics in the field. The book has a relatively low entry barrier, making it accessible to second-year undergraduate students with a basic knowledge of multivariable calculus.

This lecture note primarily organizes the content from Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 6 of the original book, which the author considers the most essential parts of the entire text. However, regarding the introduction to black hole physics in Chapter 6, since Professor Zhao’s treatment is brief, many topics are not fully explored due to space limitations. Therefore, the author has not provided a comprehensive or complete organization of this chapter. Any missing content can be found in the original book.
